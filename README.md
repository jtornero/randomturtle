A little R script for plotting 1/0 sequences with turtle graphics


My unorthodox method used in the pseudorandomness contest driven by Eric Neyman

Here are the plots for comparision:

Just run the script with the provided data and try to find any differences between computer-generated and human-generated strings.

Have fun!!!
